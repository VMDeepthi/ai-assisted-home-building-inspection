## 📌 Problem Statement
Home buyers and tenants often face hidden structural and safety issues such as
cracks, damp walls, water leakage, and exposed electrical wiring. These issues
are usually recorded in inspection notes or images but are not analyzed
systematically, leading to unsafe living conditions and poor decision-making.

There is a need for an AI-driven system that can automatically analyze inspection
data and highlight risks in a clear and understandable way.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project presents an **AI-Assisted Home & Building Inspection System** that
uses **Snowflake and AI (Snowflake Cortex / AI SQL)** to analyze inspection data.

The solution:
- Analyzes inspection text and image metadata
- Automatically detects and classifies defects
- Generates room-wise and property-level risk scores
- Produces a plain-language inspection summary for users

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Inspection data (text notes, CSV data, image labels) is collected
2. Data is stored in Snowflake as structured and unstructured data
3. Snowflake Cortex / AI SQL classifies inspection findings
4. Risk scores are assigned based on defect severity
5. Results are displayed using a simple dashboard or report

---

## 🧠 AI / ML Approach
- Snowflake Cortex / AI SQL for text analysis and defect classification
- Rule-based risk scoring using SQL
- AI-generated inspection summaries in natural language

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Snowflake Data Warehouse  
- Snowflake Cortex / AI SQL  
- SQL Worksheets  
- Python (data preprocessing)  
- Streamlit (dashboard – conceptual)  
- Cloud Storage for images  

---

## 📊 Example Output
**Risk Level:** HIGH  

**Inspection Summary:**  
> “High risk property detected. Exposed wiring in the kitchen and damp walls in
the bathroom require immediate attention.”
